TITANIC_PREDICTION

The Titanic Survival Prediction Application is an interactive tool built using Python and Tkinter, designed to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on key features such as passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard, fare paid, and port of embarkation. The application employs a Random Forest Classifier trained on the Titanic dataset to generate predictions. Users can input their passenger details into a user-friendly graphical interface, and the model will provide an output indicating whether the passenger is predicted to have survived or not. This project exemplifies the application of machine learning in a real-world scenario, allowing users to explore the factors influencing survival outcomes during the historic maritime disaster.
