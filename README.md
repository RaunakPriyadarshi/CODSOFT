SALES_PREDICTION


The Sales Prediction Application is a machine learning project designed to forecast sales figures based on advertising expenditures across three media channels: TV, radio, and newspapers. Utilizing a Linear Regression model implemented with Python's scikit-learn library, this application takes user input for advertising budgets and predicts the resulting sales figures in millions. The intuitive graphical user interface, built with Tkinter, allows users to enter their advertising amounts easily and obtain predictions with a simple click. The application effectively demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in business analytics, offering valuable insights for optimizing advertising strategies.
