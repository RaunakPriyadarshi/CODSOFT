IRIS_PREDICTION


The KNN Classifier for Iris Species Prediction is a machine learning project that utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify iris flowers based on their physical characteristics: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Built with Python, the project employs the scikit-learn library for model training and evaluation, achieving an impressive accuracy of approximately 97.06%. The user-friendly interface, developed using Tkinter, allows users to input flower measurements and receive instant predictions of the species, making the classification process accessible and engaging. This project not only demonstrates the power of machine learning in real-world applications but also serves as an educational tool for understanding classification algorithms.
